    &nbsp;<p>Dicey is a clone of the old Playstation game Devil Dice. The game 
    is played on a grid of dice. The object is to match the value on the top of 
    the dice by rolling and sliding the dice around. You need to match up two 
    dice with a 2 value on top to make them sink. Likewise, three &quot;3&quot; dice will 
    sink, four &quot;4&quot; dice will sink, and so on. Dice with a 1 will make all the 
    1's sink when placed next to a die that is already sinking. It sounds 
    complicated, but after a little practice it gets much easier.</p>
    <p><b>Project Status:</b> On hold, possibly indefinitely. I've got too many 
    other small projects, and there's no interest at all in this project.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>What Needs to be Done:</b></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Verify 
    movement rules. Seems to be finished, needs testing</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Add 
    game types. Only basic &quot;Go for high score&quot; game is implemented. 
    I'll probably add the &quot;Kill each other players&quot; game type soon.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 
    Improve game levels. Currently, the level goes up when 30 dice are sunk. To 
    increase difficulty with levels, the game will fill all the empty spaces 
    except for (20-level) spaces. So, at level 20, it fills all the available 
    spaces every pass. Somehow, I still managed to get to level 32 today...</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 
    Balance levels based on gameboard size as well as number of players</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 
    Implement special types of dice.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Once 
    game class is set, rewrite DirectX portion. Right now I'm only using very 
    basic graphics, sound, and input, just to test the game class. I'll need to 
    re-do most of it</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Remove 
    the dependence on DInput from the game class. I'm trying to make the base 
    class as stand-alone as possible.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 
    Improve front end and score displays. Draw the die that the player is riding 
    separate (like the original) so you can see hidden faces easier</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 
    Possibly add network code, to play over a LAN, or hopefully the internet</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Find a 
    graphic monkey that can do some simple 3d players and nicer dice, at the 
    very least...</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Make 
    AI rely less on rand()</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Downloads:</b></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grab 
    these at your own risk. Like I mentioned, I'm not even at alpha stages, so 
    it can be very buggy.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/DiceySource120303.zip">12/3/2003 Source Code</a> - I've 
    decided to release my source. It's not as commented as I'd like, but 
    hopefully someone will find it interesting and useful. Its almost entirely 
    game logic, the graphics and sound portions are relatively basic.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Note:</b> 
    These require DirectX 9. </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/DiceyV0.11.zip">5/14/2003 Build</a> - I've finally got all 
    traces of random movement out of the AI. It might look like its running 
    around at random sometimes, but it's actually following a computed path. But 
    it is still full of bad logic, so it will do some strange things. Two AI 
    players on a 7x7 board easily get past level 20 though (I saw a couple get 
    to level 35!), so they do pretty well. Because of the lack of random 
    movement, sometimes 2 or more AIs will start moving as a pack, so you'll 
    have to shut off their AIs to split them up. Finally, there might be a crash 
    bug hiding in it somewhere...</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/DiceyV0.10.zip">5/5/2003 Build</a> - The AI now has a working 
    brain. It not a smart brain, but it works great under the right 
    circumstances. Try it out, again using 1-5 on your keyboard to toggle 
    between Human and AI for each character. There may be a crash bug or two 
    lurking in this version, also.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/DiceyV0.9.zip">5/3/2003 Build</a> - Yep, finally, an update! 
    I finally finished the framework for AI. Right now, you can toggle a 
    player's AI by pressing their player number (1-5) on the keyboard. But, it's 
    very very dumb AI, don't expect anything good yet. </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I 
    added in another game mode. The rules are the same as always, except that 
    1s, 2s, and 3s don't do anything, ever. I call it &quot;Hardcore&quot;, but on my 
    first try I got to level 19, so maybe its not hardcore enough... :) You can 
    select this game type from the front end.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/DiceyV0.8.zip">3/15/2003 Build</a> - I fixed the remaining 
    movement glitch, I think that's pretty solid now. I fixed some sound bugs 
    that caused sounds to be played twice sometimes. I added a few more sounds, 
    and changed the &quot;Game Over&quot; sound. They sound much better, but still need 
    work. Its pretty solid right now. I think adding game types is next...</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/DiceyV0.7.zip">3/12/2003 Build</a> - I fixed the scripting I 
    broke with the DirectInput stuff. I tweaked a lot of colors, and made the 
    screen larger by default. While trying to get rid of the ugly black dots 
    between dice I turned on bilinear texture filtering, and my frame rate 
    improved. I guess I'll be keeping that. Probably a few other minor fixes 
    too. It was a long, tiring week in San Jose...</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/DiceyV0.06.zip">3/1/2003 Build</a> - I turned on lighting, 
    which looks nice, but may crash some people. I use directional lights 
    without checking to see if your card supports them. I don't think that's an 
    issue though, if it was a point light I'd have to worry. DirectInput is working, and you can configure input for all 5 players. I 
    only have a keyboard and 1 joystick though, so I cant be positive that it 
    will work. I know that I can control 5 players with just my joystick though. 
    :) I put my old player &quot;model&quot; in. Still needs a ton of tweaking, its far from 
    polished. </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/DiceyV0.05.zip">2/20/2003 Build</a> - Can now record and 
    playback games. I've added a sample game (my best ever!) that you can watch. 
    Maybe it will give you a better idea of how to play, until I add more 
    scripting for tutorials. The front end had more options added, so you can 
    record and playback games. For now, it only uses one script, &quot;TestScript&quot;, 
    that will be written over if you record a game. I also added a few new 
    sounds. They're still not so great, but better than me talking I think.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/DiceyV0.04.zip">2/16/2003 Build</a> - Basic front end is in place, 
    and a level system is working.  If you can make it to level 20, you're 
    pretty dang good. If you can make it to level 30, well, you wont get to 
    level 30. :P You can select up to 5 players, but only players 1 and 2 are 
    usable. Players 3-5 will just sit there.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I 
    added an orthographic camera. Toggle between perspective and orthographic by 
    hitting P. increase/decrease orthographic volume (zoom) with V and B. I cant 
    decide which camera I like better. Perspective looks nice, but dice in back 
    get hard to see. Orthographic is disorienting at first. Maybe once I get 
    lighting in, the shading will make it better.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/DiceyV0.03.zip">2/14/2003 Build</a> - Fixed Win98 bug. Started to 
    work on a level system. Now, the game is much easier. So easy in fact, that 
    you cant lose. The game will occasionally fill up the board so up to half of 
    the board is covered. This has problems, as well, but at the very least its 
    much easier to play.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/How_To_PlayV0.02.htm">How to Play</a> - Due to popular 
    demand, I typed up some quick instructions. I hope they make sense. Its very 
    hard to describe things without being able to show you in game. But I am 
    working on in-game tutorials.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/DiceyV0.02.zip">2/10/2003 Build</a> - Player moves accurately 
    now, including animation. Still much too hard, but the foundation of the 
    basic game is there.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/Dicey_V.01.zip">2/3/2003 Build</a> - Includes very ugly 
    sound. I talked into a microphone for some quick placeholder sound. I don't 
    recommend playing it, its too annoying. :) Use the arrow keys to move player 
    1, and WASD to move player 2. You can move the camera with the keys IKJLYH; 
    IK for the y-axis, JL for the x-axis, and YH for the z-axis.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <a href="Dicey/dice.zip">Old version.</a> I made this a long time ago, but 
    scrapped most of it. Because of the way I did things, it became very hard to 
    tweak movement rules, and add features. I was focusing on graphics at the 
    time, and adding a game to it while I learned. That didn't go well. :)</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Project Diary:</b></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    2/11/2003: It looks like I fixed the problem with Windows98. I'm amazed it 
    worked at all on XP. I'm still having weird issues with VS.NET. I have 
    problems disappear by commenting code, compiling, uncommenting the code, and 
    recompiling. Going to start running things through VC6 when I hit a strange 
    problem.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    2/14/2003: Started game level system. Need to make it so dice spawn, 
    regardless of how full the board is, after a certain time. Started using CVS 
    for source control. Now if only I could make it auto-increment my build 
    number.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    2/14/2003 part2: It seems that I'm stealing a lot of CPU cycles somehow. 
    Running Winamp and Dicey on a slower computer is interesting. Independently, 
    they show almost no CPU use. Together, both of their CPU usage spikes. 
    Bugger.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    2/15/2003: Huh, it seems drawing text with full transparency makes it so you 
    cant see the text. Who'd have thought? :P</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    2/16/2003: The game actually seems like a game now. Still need to add a 
    tutorial, but that'd involve adding some sort of scripting, and I've been 
    putting that off. Still a movement graphic glitch I need to fix (smashed 
    players look unsmashed for a sec when they move).</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    2/19/2003: I've got the basics of scripting in. I'm using the game to build 
    script data, and then replaying it back. I actually got it to work halfway 
    decent, but the way it runs now the replays only work for a few seconds. 
    Then, because of differences in frame rates while recording and playing 
    back, the player in the replay ends up diverging from what was recorded. I 
    think I have a fix for that, but that's going to take some rewriting of my 
    main game loop. So far it also only works if I make a game with 2 players, 
    otherwise it crashes on a free(). Yay!</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've 
    also redone some sounds. I made a new &quot;clunk&quot; by hitting my laptop case 
    while my cheapo microphone was pointed on it. I made a new &quot;slide&quot; by 
    sliding a box on my laptop case. I then processed the heck out of both using 
    FruityLoops, so they don't sound quite as crummy. I got a new &quot;zap&quot; from 
    some zappy sound I found online, and just adjusted its pitch a little and 
    added a touch of reverb. And, it still sounds pretty bad. I guess I'm no 
    sound engineer.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    2/20/2003: Holy cow, scripting works flawlessly. Although I only have 2 
    script commands (make rising dice, and change player input), but thats 
    enough to record a game and play it back. And it works! Holy beans.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    2/25/2003: Took a few days off, and played a lot of games. Bad me. Started 
    working on DirectInput, so I can get joystick and gamepad support in. So 
    far, Dinput says I have 2 mice. Hmm.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    2/28/2003: Got DirectInput working pretty well. Now I think you can actually 
    play with 5 people, if you have enough controllers or can crowd around your 
    keyboard. Enabled lighting, which looks nice, but will probably cause 
    trouble. Put in my old player &quot;model&quot;. Found an ugly bug that allows players 
    to move dice out form under other moving players, causing them to fall on 
    the ground. That's no good...</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    3/10/2003: Spent last week at the Game Developers Conference. Noticed that I 
    borked my scripting with the last update, and fixed it. Also fixed a 
    movement glitch, and gave players a position offset so they don't draw on top 
    of each other. Probably caught a couple other things while I was gone too. 
    Started trying to make some nicer dice with free 3d tools. That's not going 
    well... Maybe I'll work on music or something. Still need to fix one 
    movement bug. You should be able to push players that on the floor with 
    sliding dice. Currently, players in the way get smashed, and that looks 
    odd...</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    3/12/2003: Still mostly working on making better assets. If anyone can 
    recommend a decent 3d modeler that's free or cheap, let me know. I've been 
    playing with <a href="http://www.blender3d.org">Blender</a>, and that's not 
    going well. Just building a cube, texturing it, and exporting it to a useful 
    format is like pulling teeth. Actually, pulling teeth is probably easier. I 
    played with the
    <a href="http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/ms3d/index.html">
    Milkshape3D</a> trial version too, and its not nearly powerful enough. If I 
    cant make a cube that is exactly centered at the origin, and exactly 1 unit 
    cubed, then that's not powerful enough. Keyboard entry is a must, I cant do 
    things freehand.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    4/22/2003: Woo, been a while since I updated. I've gotten sidetracked with 
    other things for a while. I've been trying to beta test four games 
    simultaneously, and trying to find places that need programmers. In the 
    meantime, I've been thinking a lot about the direction of Dicey. I will 
    finish it, but I don't think it will be nearly as full featured as the real 
    Devil Dice game. There's nearly no interest in Dicey so far, so I'll 
    probably just polish up the basic game, and maybe see about making some AI. 
    Then I'll be on to my next project. But, it will get finished!</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    5/3/2003: Framework for the AI is in place, I just need to finish writing 
    all the AI utility functions. Then maybe I can get to writing actual AI 
    logic. Right now the AI picks a direction solely through the use of rand(). 
    Its fun to set up a large game with 5 players, turn on all of their AI, see 
    how far they get and who wins.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    5/5/2003: I've created a monster! My AI's brain is starting to work. Right 
    now, the brain only knows how to make paths to positions that create a 
    match. So, the AI will see if it can find a path, and if so follow it. 
    Unfortunately, when finished it will fins a path from that position. So, if 
    it finds another path, it will destroy the match it just made. I put in a 
    quick hack so the AI will potentially leave newly created matches alone, but 
    it is far from reliable.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AI 
    will only knows how to roll dice to make matches. If it cant find a good 
    path, or its on an unrollable die, or its on the floor, or anything else, it 
    will move randomly. So, it still looks like a mess. But you can tell the AI 
    is working. With 5 completely random AI's on a 7x7 board, I saw them get to 
    level 13 on normal, and only level 1 on hardcore. With 5 new AI's on a 7x7 
    board, they got to level 33 on normal, and level 10 on hardcore. Thats quite 
    an improvement. Level 33 and over 3000 points isnt too shabby for AI that 
    goes in a random direction over 80% of the time. Later I'll record myself 
    playing against 4 AI, and see how poorly I do. </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Edit</i>: 
    I just finished a game with 4 AIs, in normal mode, on a 7x7 board. I beat 
    them as far as points goes, with the closest AI having 3000 points less. 
    But, we made it to level 71! There's a sure sign that the level system 
    needs work... I should really use an 11x11 board with 5 players, at least.</p>

    5/10/2003: I've been making progress on the AI, but I haven't released a new 
    version because I've actually made it worse. If it doesn't get stuck, it 
    does amazingly well. But it gets stuck a lot, moving back and forth over and 
    over, and that needs to be fixed. I've also fixed a few crash bugs, and 
    hopefully the last movement bug. </p>

    5/12/2003: Well, the AI gets stuck a lot less. But, it still happens now and 
    then. I have the AI keeping track of dice that it is matching up, but it 
    seems like it's ignoring that list. It actually looks much more random now, 
    even though it doesn't use rand() anymore. It still doesn't know how to get 
    to a rising die, so if it gets stuck on the floor it will sit there. I've 
    also got a new crash that has me confused. A few more days, and I should 
    have a new release ready.</p>

    5/14/2003: The AI does really well, but it still does some stupid things. 
    Lots more work needs to be done. I think I'm almost at the point where I can 
    focus on AI logic though. So far, I've been writing little tools that the AI 
    will use in pretty basic ways. Once they're bug-free I can make the AI use 
    them better.</p>

    12/03/2003: I finally decided that this project is dead for a while. While 
    I've always had ideas for improving it, I havent had the time or drive to 
    implement them. There is virtually no interest anyways, which makes it hard 
    to bother with it. Plus, Devil Dice 3 (Bombastic) was released in the US, so 
    I have that to play, instead of being forced to write my own version. :)</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've 
    also put the source code up for download. Maybe it'll help someone.</p>
