Dicey V0.02</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- This will be much 
easier when I can put a tutorial in the game, I hope this make a little sense.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Basics:</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
object is to match up the value on the top of dice. You do this by rolling and 
sliding the dice around.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Because this is such an early build, everything is represented by a die. Player 
1 is a small die with a 1 on the top, and player 2 is a small die with a 2 on 
the top.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
players move by using the keyboard. Player 1 uses the arrow keys, and player 2 
uses the WASD keys.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Scoring:</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Players get points by &quot;sinking&quot; sets of dice. To sink dice, you must move around 
dice so the top value matches the top value of surrounding dice. Two or more 
dice with a two on top will sink when placed next to each other. Three or more 
dice with a three on top will sink when placed next to each other, and so on.
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
exception are dice with a one on top. Do sink these, you must move a die with a 
one on top next to a die that in already sinking. This will cause all the one's 
to sink, except the one the player may be riding on.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When 
you create sinking dice, your score increases by an amount that depends on the 
type and number of dice you sunk. The formula is<i> Score = number of dice * top 
value of dice</i>. So, if you sink five dice with a three on top, you get 15 
points.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Combos:</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You 
can increase your score further by creating combos. This is done by moving a die 
next to a set of matching dice that are already sinking. The score you get from 
a combo is determined by the formula <i>Score = number of dice * top value of 
dice * combo multiplier. </i>Every time you do this with the same set o sinking 
dice, your combo multiplier increases. When creating a combo, the same rules 
apply as for creating normal sinkers. You must have the correct number of 
matching dice to create a combo. For example, moving a die with a 4 on the top 
next to three matching dice that are sinking, you will create a combo because 
you've matched the minimum of 4 dice.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Hints for movement:</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Getting the correct value on the top of the die, and in the position you want, 
takes practice. Here are a couple things that I hope will help.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
values on opposites sides of the die will always add up to seven. So, if the 
side you can see is a 3, you know the opposite side is a 4.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If 
you have the value you want on the top of the die, its easy to keep that value 
while moving horizontally or vertically, if you have enough room. Unfortunately, 
this will be hard to explain without pictures... So lets try an example.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say 
you have the correct value on the top of your die, but you need to move it 
directly to the right. Roll the die one space down. Then, you can roll the die 
as far left or right as you want, and your value with stay on the same side. 
When you get it to the right position, roll 1 space up, and your die will be how 
you wanted it.</p>
