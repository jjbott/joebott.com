    I've decided to start creating the games in the
    <a href="http://www.gipf.com/">Gipf Project</a> using Visual Basic 6, for 
    practice. I'll chronicle my progress here, but I wont be providing binaries 
    or source until I get permission from the creator of the games.<p align="left">

    <b>Tamsk</b><p align="center">
    <a href="gipf/tamsk.gif">

    I started with the game <a href="http://www.gipf.com/tamsk/index.html">Tamsk</a>. 
    The bulk of the project was finished in less than a day, although there is 
    still much more work that could be done. All of the game is implemented 
    except a 15-second timer used to limit player's turn times. The interface is 
    fairly basic, but worked surprisingly well for my first attempt. Only 
    hotseat gameplay is implemented, so after implementing most of the game I 
    moved on after I got sick of playing against myself.<p align="left">

    Next I moved to <a href="http://www.gipf.com/dvonn/index.html">Dvonn</a>. 
    This also took roughly a day to implement the bulk of the game, although it 
    took a few more days to polish the interface and get network play working. 
    The interface is still a bit ugly, but advances beyond the Tamsk interface 
    include the display of pieces with valid moves, display of all valid moves 
    from a position, and display of the last turn. It has the ability to host or 
    join a network game, which seems to work pretty well. Again, more work could 
    be done, but I decided to move on since at that point I didn't know if I'd 
    be able to show the game to anyone besides myself.<p align="center">

    <b>Zertz</b><p align="center">
    <a href="gipf/zertz.gif">

    Next up is
    <a href="http://www.gipf.com/zertz/index.html">Zertz</a>. While researching, 
    I noticed that someone had already written a version of Zertz called
    <a href="http://assimilate.int.webmatrixhosting.net/zf1/">ZF1</a>. I already 
    wanted to improve my interface attempts, but ZF1 inspired me to start 
    interface improvements with this project instead of waiting. I drew some 256x256 32bit graphics, which 
    I scale and draw with alpha blending for anti-aliased edges. 
    Unfortunately, that is serious overkill, since you cant really see the 
    anti-aliasing when I shrink the images so much. The result is that it runs 
    very slow on older computers, but dang does it look nice! Optimizing the 
    graphics shouldn't be a problem though. I also wrote fairly robust hex-board 
    drawing routines that should come in handy for the rest of the games. I can 
    now resize the window and the board will always be centered and sized 
    perfectly, with any shape board. As of now, it only plays a very basic 
    &quot;beginner&quot; style game, but all that is needed to play more advanced styles 
    of the game is to complete a configuration interface. There's no network play implementation yet, 
    and there's still interface work to be done, but again I think I'm going to 
    wait until I have permission to release my work before I put too much more 
    work into it.<p align="left">

    Most recently I've been working on
    <a href="http://www.gipf.com/yinsh/index.html">Yinsh</a>. Again, it took 
    about a day to get the gameplay roughed out. I decided to drop the fancy 
    graphics of Zertz, and just work on the interface from a more basic level. 
    It will be easy to drop in bitmapped graphics later on. Because of this, I 
    didn't draw actual rings for the rings, those are the larger circles in the 
    pictures. Handling multiple lines was an interesting challenge, but I think 
    I worked out a pretty intuitive interface for line selection. I was thinking 
    of animating the markers flipping over, but that'd take some graphic work, 
    so I'd rather wait. Maybe I'll do it for the game's second pass.<p align="center">
    <b>Gipf</b><p align="left">
    I'm currently working on the design of
    <a href="http://www.gipf.com/gipf/index.html">Gipf</a>. This is the only 
    game where you can choose which type of game piece you want to use. So, I'm 
    struggling to come up with something intuitive for game piece selection 
    that's not too slow and clumsy. It gets even more complicated if I allow 
    potentials as well. So I'm mostly working on other projects while I kick 
    around ideas for this.</td>
